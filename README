python version: 3.9.5
platform: GNU/Linux:amd64

This project is recycled from the previous assignment. The script file has to be started in the exact order like before: server.py -> reverse_proxy.py -> client.py. Both the client and server script are the same as before; the only new added feature is the reverse_proxy.py which will intercept any bi-directional communication between the server and the client. The proxy will reject any data that is not considered a "digit".
